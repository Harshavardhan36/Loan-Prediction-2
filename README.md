# Loan Prediction Model

This repository contains a data science project focused on building a predictive model to determine loan approval status based on customer data. The dataset is derived from a loan approval case study.

## 🧠 Project Objective

The goal is to predict whether a loan will be approved or not, using various customer attributes like income, loan amount, credit history, and more. This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, visualization, model training, evaluation, and predictions.

## 📁 Files

- `PROJECTTTTTT.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with all the code, visualizations, and modeling steps.
- `train_ctrUa4K.csv`: Training dataset (assumed to be stored locally for modeling).
- (Optional: Add links or references to dataset source if public)

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn (for model building)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Workflow Summary

1. **Data Loading**: Read and inspect the dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Understand feature distributions and correlations.
3. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables.
4. **Model Building**: Train classification models such as Logistic Regression.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using accuracy and other metrics.
6. **Prediction**: Apply the model to test data (if applicable).

## 📊 Results

The logistic regression model is trained and evaluated, and accuracy is computed for validation folds.

## 📌 How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure the dataset file `train_ctrUa4K.csv` is placed at the correct path.
3. Open `PROJECTTTTTT.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
4. Run all cells sequentially.
